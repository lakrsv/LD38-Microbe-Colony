The game will be a hexagon grid-based game. 

The main genre of the game is strategy simulation.

You control a colony of microbes and need to expand control over the map.

Possible colony types will be based on types of microbes, possible colonies may be:
	- Bacteria - Basic colony. This is the Player colony. Future might allow for different player colonies but for now, this is out of scope.
	- Viruses - Not strictly colonies, are wanderers and if they infect members of your colony may replicate quickly and mess you up.
	- Fungi - Maybe out of scope for Ludum Dare.

You can discover other colonies of microbes. 

The colonies you discover can be hostile or neutral.

You can establish relationship with colonies. The relationships are based on symbiosis, possible relationships may be:
	- Commensalism - One benefits, the other is not harmed nor helped.
	- Mutualism - Both benefit from relationships.
	- Parasitism - One orgasm benefits, host is harmed.

Two modes of play: Freeplay and Win-condition. (Maybe multiple selectable win conditions?)

You should be able to construct your base. Your units are your base, they can evolve through normal morphological stages.

You can upgrade components of the basic unit of your colony. Possible components are based on the microbe composition, and for bacteria may be:
	- Mictochondria (Power generator)
	- Flagella (Movement speed)
	- Cell Wall (Shield)
	- Cell Membrane (Hull)
	- Pili (Resource Transfer)

Resources are based on bacterial metabolism for a bacteria colony.
	Organotrophs - Organic compounds
	Phototrophs - Sunlight (Out of scope for Player in Ludum Dare)
	Lithotrophs - Inorganic compounds (Out of scope for Player in Ludum Dare)
